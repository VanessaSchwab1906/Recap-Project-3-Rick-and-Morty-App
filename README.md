# Recap Project 3: Rick and Morty App

In this recap project we created a single page app for browsing all the characters of the famous tv show "Rick and Morty".

To fetch all necessary information about the characters we used a REST API specifically designed for Rick and Morty and implemented a pagination to see all the characters.

The app also contains a search bar to search individual characters by typing
their name into it.
